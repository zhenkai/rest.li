Fix to PSON deserialization issues.
PSON responses should not deserialize correctly.
The default representation for PSON strings is now a length-encoded string.
All length encoded strings are now encoded with a two byte length by default.  This is a backwards-
incompatible change.

(RB=136944)
Allow Content-Types to include an optional Charset.  For now it is ignored, but including it will
no longer allow either the client or the server to be unable to parse the Content-Type.

(RB=129193)
fix a bug where the LoadBalancer config gets overwritten by empty map and causes D2 Strategy
to not instantiate properly

(RB=123406)
Change to allow clients to request data in pson-encoded format (and interpet pson-encoded data),
and for servers to be able to send pson-encoded responses.

Clients can signify that a response should be in pson format by sending the request with the
header "Accept-Type : application/x-pson".  The server will then encode the result in pson and
send it back with the header "Content-Type : application/x-pson". If the client recieves a
response with this header it will decode it with the pson codec.

Some headers will now work a bit differently:
Content-Type headers will no longer be sent with responses unless there is actual body content
to encode.  This change was made primarily to simplify picking the right header.  There's no
point in trying to figure out the right content-type header to send back if there isn't
actually any content to send.
Accept-Type headers can now be sent with requests.  The default client won't send Accept-Type
headers (same as the old code), but users can use the new RestClient constructor to create a
client that will send Accept-Type headers.  Right now there are four basic options for
Accept-Type headers:
 - no header: server will send back result as application/json.  This is required for backwards
   compatibility.
 - application/json highest quality in header: server will send back result as application/json
 - application/x-pson highest quality in header: server will send back result as
   application/x-pson.  If the server code is old, result will be sent back as application/json
 - */* highest quality in header: for now, server will send back result as application/json, if
   no other accept types are found.  However, the server will prefer to send back responses in
   formats that are explicitly mentioned in the header, even when they are lower quality than */*

(RB=128653)
ActionResponseDecoder.getEntity() will return Void.class if its fieldDef is
null, to preserve compatibility from before the Action response changes.

(RB=128251)
Add javadoc to rest.li docgen and include restspec.json files as resource in rest.li server jars.

1.7.8

(RB=119453)
Add default value handling for query parameter in complex type, including all DataTemplate subclasses, array of simple types and complex types.
Union can be used as query parameter type.

(RB=127439)
Fix NPE resulting from calling .getEntityClass() on an ActionResponseDecoder for a void-returning Action.

1.7.7
-----
(RB=123370)
Add TextDataCodec to support serializing and deserializing to String, Writer and Reader.
Move getStringEncoding() from DataCodec to TextDataCodec interface. This is potentially
a backwards incompatible change.

Replace use of ByteArrayInputStream(string.getBytes(Data.UTF_8_CHARSET)) with new JacksonDataCodec
and SchemaParser APIs that take String as input.

1.7.6
-----
(RB=122933)
If union is named because it is typeref'ed, the typeref schema was
originally not available through the generated code. This change
add a new HasTyperefInfo interface. If the union is named through
through typeref, the generated subclass of UnionTemplate will also
implement this interface. This interface provides the TyperefInfo
of the typeref that names the union.

(RB=121895)
Fix encoding bug in QueryTunnel Util.
Make ByteString.toString() to return a summary instead of the whole
array as an Avro string.
HttpBridge for RPC requests should not log the whole entity.

-----
(RB=122372)
RequestContext should not be shared across requests in ParSeqRestClient

-----
(RB=122016)
Add support for Avro 1.6. To use Avro 1.6, depend on data-avro_1_6.
Also fix getBytes() to explicitly specify UTF-8. This has no impact
on platforms whose default encoding is UTF-8.

Add DataList serialization and deserialization to JacksonDataCodec.

1.7.2
-----
(RB=120743)
Infer order of include and fields properties of record if location information is not available.

Change generated and up-to-date log messages to info. This was useful initially for debugging. Since
it has not been a problem, changing to info will reduce build output noise from generator.

(RB=120925)
Add requisite maven configuration and pom generation to root build.gradle to enable releasing pegasus
to maven central.

(RB=120249)
Copy 'pegasus' gradle plugin into pegasus codebase from RUM, so 3rd party developers have access to
the build tools required for a working development flow.  Also add maven central and maven local as repos
so developers can publish pegasus artifacts to their local repo and build standalone apps based on those
artifacts (this part will not be needed after we push pegasus artifacts to the maven central repo but
helps in the short term).

(RB=119121)
Fixed an issue where Actions that declare their return types as primitives (return int instead of
Integer, for example) no longer fail while trying to coercer the response into the correct type.

1.7.1
-----
Bad build, not published

1.7.0
-----
(RB=116297)
Add Schema compatibility checker. See com.linkedin.data.schema.compatibility.CompatibilityChecker and
CompatibilityOptions for details.

There is a change in MessageList class to take a type parameter. This is binary compatible but may
result in unchecked compilation warning/errors (depending on compiler setting.) Impact should be
minimum since this class is mostly for use within pegasus. However, it leaked by data-transform
package by DataProcessingException. This has been fixed to use List<Message> instead of MessageList.

(RB=118831)
In idl compatibility checker, allow parameter optional to be upgraded to default, and allow default to be downgraded to optional.

Fix bug in Avro generator in which referenced schema is not generated even
if schema file or name is explicitly mentioned as input args to avro schema
generator.

(RB=117895)
Fix bug in Avro schema and data translator that occurs when optional typeref
of union present. Significantly improve test coverage for typeref for avro
data and schema translation.

Add Request.getResourcePath() to provide access to the resource path parts that uniquely identify what resource the request is for.

(RB=118345)
Fix a bug where @AssocKeys of CustomTypes would cause IDL generation to crash.
Added test cases for @AssocKeys of CustomTypes.

------
(RB=116608)
Preserve PropertyEventBusImpl constructor backward compatibility

1.6.9
-----
(RB=111712)
Split original Restli example server/client into two versions: Basic and D2. The Basic version does not contain any D2 features.
Improve the D2 version of server and client to fully utilize D2.
Add gradle tasks to start all the variants of servers and clients.
Add gradle task to write D2-related configuration to ZooKeeper.

(RB=111517)
Restore method signatures changed in 1.6.7 to preserve backward compatibility

1.6.8
-----
Revert "Don't log entity body in Rest{Request,Response}Impl.toString(), since it's likely to log sensitive data."

1.6.7
-----
(RB=111517)
Fix a bug in batching multiple get requests into one, and refactor query parameters handling in
Request and RequestBuilder hierarchy.

(RB=108674)
Custom Types will now work as keys.
Keys keep track of their own schemas.
Reference types for keys are annotated in the class level annotation, as a new parameter in
RestLiCollection as keyTyperefClass, or as part of the @Key annotation for associations.

(RB=TBD)
Added docgen to restli-server-standalone config.

(RB=101117)
Custom Types will now work with action parameters.
FieldDefs/Params now keep track of their own schemas.
Action parameter metadata is now calculated in a static block in generated builder code --
no longer generated on the fly at call-time.
Action response metadata is now also calculated in a static block or in the AnnotationReader,
rather than on the fly at call-time.

Fixed a typeref bug that would cause non-custom type typerefs to appear in builders as their
reference types rather than their underlying types.

1.6.6
-----
(RB=112754)
Fix SI-515.  Escape '.'s in keys from QueryParamDataMap so AnyRecords can be encoded as query params.

(RB=106343)
Fix url escaping of string when used as keys in rest.li. (SI-495)

1.6.5
-----
(RB=109987)

-----
(RB=103500)
Move non-LI-specific part of photo server example into pegasus.

Integrate compatibility level into idl checker. The exit code of the main function now depends on both
the check result and the level.

(RB=106155)
Fix incorrect handling of absent optional complex query parameters.

1.6.0
-----
(RB=101499)
Add "validatorPriority" to enable validator execution order to be specified.
See details in DataSchemaAnnotationValidator class.

 * <b>Validator Execution Order</b>
 * <p>
 *
 * Execution ordering of multiple validators specified within the same "validate"
 * property is determined by the "validatorPriority" property of each validator.
 *
 * <code>
 *   "validate" : {
 *     "higherPriorityValidator" : {
 *       "validatorPriority" : 1
 *     },
 *     "defaultPriorityValidator" : {
 *     },
 *     "lowerPriorityValidator" : {
 *       "validatorPriority" : -1
 *     }
 *   }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 *
 * The higher the priority value, the higher the priority of the validator, i.e.
 * a validator with higher prority value will be executed before the validators
 * with lower priority values. The default priority value for a validator that
 * does not specify a priority value is 0. Execution order of validators with
 * the same priority value is not defined or specified.
 * <p>
 *
 * Validators may be attached to a field as well as the type of the field.
 * This class will always execute the validators associated to the type of the field
 * before it will execute the validators associated with the field.
 * <p>
 *
 * If schema of a data element is a typeref, then the validator associated with
 * the typeref is executed after the validator of the referenced type.
 * <p>
 *
 * Beyond the above execution ordering guarantees provided by this class,
 * the execution order of validators among different data elements is determined
 * by the traversal order of the caller (i.e. how data elements passed to the
 * {@link #validate(ValidatorContext)} method of this class. Typically, the caller will be
 * {@link com.linkedin.data.schema.validation.ValidateDataAgainstSchema}
 * and this caller performs a post-order traversal of data elements.

There is an incompatible semantic change. Previously the outer typeref validators
are executed before the inner typeref validators.

(RB=104954)
Fix bug to not throw NPE when include schema is not valid.
When RuntimeException is thrown by code generator, make sure that accummulated
parser messages are emitted through a RuntimeException to help diagnose the

(RB=95037)
Generated rest client builders now contain Javadoc extracted from .restspec.json files.
Such document originally comes from the Javadoc of corresponding resource classes.

1.5.5
-----
(RB=94738)
Add consistency check between SSLContext and SSLParameters arguments
of HttpNettyClient constructor.

(RB=95371)

classes using the current thread's contextClassLoader.

1.5.4
-----
(RB=93597)
Enhance JSR330Adapter to support injection via constructor arguments,
allowing a safer coding practice of declaring final member variables
in rest.li resources.

(RB=92918)
RestLiResourceModelExporter now returns a GeneratorResult of files modified/created so it is more consistent with the
other generator classes.

1.5.3
-----
(RB=93836)
Detect class name conflicts that occur when a generated class name
is the same as the class name for a NamedDataSchema.
Also clean up DataTemplateGenerator code.
Array items and map values of generated classes is always the

Remove support for RpcEndpointGenerator and ExceptionTemplates - this functionality has been
deprecated and is currently unused.

(RB=92505)
Fix bug that restli-docgen fail to initialize when a resource has 2 or more subresources.
This is because the hierarchy stack is not popped after visiting a resource.

Display the full name (namespace + resource name) of resources and subresource in HTML.
If the resource does not have namespace, only display resource name.

1.4.1
-----
(RB=92103)
Allow directory command line arg for rest client builder generator.
The reason for this change is that network build is invoking the generator
for each file because there is no clean and safe way to pass a list of
file names in the java ant task.

After this change, network build can pass the directory as a single argument and
the generator will scan for restspec.json files in the directory.

1.4.0

add to map and passing the map to DataSchemaAnnotationValidator.

 * The value of this property must be a {@link DataMap}. Each entry in this {@link DataMap}

 * {@link Validator} subclass to instantiate.
 *  <p>
 *
 * The key to {@link Validator} class lookup algorithm first looks up the key-to-class
 * map provided to the constructor to obtain the {@link Validator} subclass. If the key
 * does not exist in the map, then look for a class whose name is equal to the
 * provided key and is a subclass of {@link Validator}. If there is no match,
 * then look for a class whose fully qualified name is derived from the provided by key
 * by using "com.linkedin.data.schema.validator" as the Java package name and capitalizing
 * the first character of the key and appending "Validator" to the key as the name
 * of the class, and the class is a subclass of {@link Validator}.

To make sure custom Java class bound via typeref are initialized that their static initializers are
executed to register coercers, the code generator will generate a call Custom.initializeCustomClass
for each custom class referenced by a type.

For generality, this Custom.initializeCustomClass is called regardless of whether the coercer class
is also explicitly specified.

The way in which explicit coercer class initialization is performed has also changed to use
Class.forName(String className, boolean initializer, ClassLoader classLoader) with the initialize
flag set to true. This will cause the class to initialized without accessing the REGISTER_COERCER
static variable or trying to construct an instance of the coercer class. This allows the use of
static initializer block to initialize explicitly specified coercer class.

This change is not backwards compatible if the Coercer depends on constructing a new instance
to register the coercer.

(RB=84726)
Add more test code for AvroOverrideFactory. Fixed a few bugs, i.e when schema/name and translator/class is not

(RB=84335)
Add support for custom data translator for translating from Avro to Pegasus data representation when there
is a custom Avro schema binding.

 * A custom Avro schema is provided via as follows:
 * <pre>
 *   {
 *     "type" : "record",
 *     "name" : "AnyRecord",
 *     "fields" : [ ... ],
 *     ...
 *     "avro" : {
 *       "schema" : {
 *         "type" : "record",
 *         "name" : "AnyRecord",
 *         "fields" : [
 *           {
 *             "name" : "type",
 *             "type" : "string"
 *           },
 *           {
 *             "name" : "value",
 *             "type" : "string"
 *           }
 *         ]
 *       },
 *       "translator" : {
 *         "class" : "com.foo.bar.AnyRecordTranslator"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If the "avro" property is present, it provides overrides that
 * override the default schema and data translation. The "schema"
 * property provides the override Avro schema. The "translator"
 * property provides the class for that will be used to translate
 * from the to and from Pegasus and Avro data representations.
 * Both of these properties are required if either is present.
 *
 * If an override Avro schema is specified, the schema translation
 * inlines the value of the "schema" property into the translated
 * Avro schema.
 *
 * If a translator class is specified, the data translator will
 * construct an instance of this class and invoke this instance
 * to translate the data between Pegasus and Avro representations.

(RB=80898)
Allow query parameters to be custom types (SI-318)

Example customType annotation:
   * @QueryParam(value="o", typeref=CustomObjectRef.class) CustomObject o

CustomObject.

Users must also write and register a coercer that converts from the custom object to the
underlying type and back.

Add support for custom Avro schema binding to Pegasus to Avro Schema translator.

   * A custom Avro schema is provided via as follows:
   * <pre>
   *   {
   *     "type" : "record",
   *     "name" : "AnyRecord",
   *     "fields" : [ ... ],
   *     ...
   *     "avro" : {
   *       "schema" : {
   *       "type" : "record",
   *       "name" : "AnyRecord",
   *       "fields" : [
   *         {
   *           "name" : "type",
   *           "type" : "string"
   *         },
   *         {
   *           "name" : "value",
   *           "type" : "string"
   *         }
   *       ]
   *     }
   *   }
   * </pre>
   *
   * If the "avro" property has a "schema" property, the value of this
   * property provides the translated Avro schema for this type. No further
   * translation or processing is performed. It simply inlines the value
   * of this property into the translated Avro schema.

(RB=81960)
Prototype custom class for records (not for production use yet.)

Enable auto-registration of coercer when it is not possible to use
a static initializer on the custom class to register. Here is the
comments from com.linkedin.data.template.Custom.

  /**
   * Initialize coercer class.
   *
   * The preferred pattern is that custom class will register a coercer
   * through its static initializer. However, it is not always possible to
   * extend the custom class to add a static initializer.
   *
   * In this situation, an optional coercer class can also be specified
   * with the custom class binding declaration in the schema.
   *
   * <pre>
   * {
   *   "java" : {
   *     "class" : "java.net.URI",
   *     "coercerClass" : "com.linkedin.common.URICoercer"
   *   }
   * }
   * </pre>
   *
   * When another type refers to this type, the generated class for referrer
   * class will invoke this method on the coercer class within the referrer
   * class's static initializer.
   *
   * This method will reflect on the coercer class. It will attempt to read
   * the {@code REGISTER_COERCER} static field of the class if this field is declared
   * in the class. This static field may be private.
   * If such a field is not found or cannot be read, this method will attempt
   * to construct a new instance of the coercer class with the default constructor
   * of the coercer class. Either of these actions should cause the static initializer
   * of the coercer class to be invoked. The static initializer
   * is expected to register the coercer using {@link #registerCoercer}.
   * If both of these actions fail, then this method throws an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
   *
   * Note: Simply referencing to the coercer class using a static variable or
   * getting the class of the coercer class does not cause the static
   * initializer of the coercer class to be invoked. Hence, there is a need
   * actually access a field or invoke a method to cause the static initializer
   * to be invoked.
   *
   * The preferred implementation pattern for coercer class is as follows:
   *
   * <pre>
   * public class UriCoercer implements DirectCoercer<URI>
   * {
   *   static
   *   {
   *     Custom.registerCoercer(URI.class, new UriCoercer());
   *   }
   *
   *   private static final Object REGISTER_COERCER = null;
   *   ...
   * }
   * </pre>

Usability fixes to RestLiResponseException - use GetMode.NULL for accessors, add hasXyz() methods.

(RB=73936)
Clean up Exception handling in RestClient.  Previously, one could receive different exception
types for the same error in the Callback interface versus the two flavors of Future interface.

For example, if the server returned a valid error response, the caller of
ResponseFuture.getResponse() would receive a RestLiResponseException, but Callback.onError()
or the caller of Future.get() would receive a RestException.

Now, a RestLiResponseException is always generated when a valid error response is received from
the server.  Users of the Callback interface will receive a RestLiResponseException in
Callback.onError().  The ResponseFuture interface will throw a RestLiResponseException,
while the standard Future interface will throw a RestLiResponseException wrapped in an
ExecutionException.

(RB=73689)
Remove dependency on ASM and Jersey package scanning logic.  Our ASM version is fairly
old, and presents a compatibility challenge, especially for open source usage.

This patch removes the relevant Jersey code and implements very simple package scanning
by loading the classes in the specified packages.  In theory this could waste more
resources by loading classes unnecessarily.  In practice, we expect the rest.li resource
packages to be fairly narrowly specified, so it should not be a significant issue.

(RB=73067)
Improve exception message when there are Avro to Pegasus data translation errors.
This changes what DataTranslationException includes in getMessage().

(RB=72875)
Add Data to Avro Schema translation mode called OptionalDefaultMode. This mode allows
the user to control how optional fields with default value is translated. The previous
behavior is to translate the default value. This new option allows all optional fields
to be translated to have default value of null (instead of the translated default value.)

This is appropriate for Avro because the default value is only used if it is present
in the reader schema and absent in the writer schema. By translating default value to
null, the absent field will have null as its value (which is a better indication of
absence and would translate more cleanly to Pegasus as an absent field). I think this
is more correct, then filling in with the translated default value for an absent field.

In addition, this also improves the Pegasus user experience. If the user did not specify
a default value for field, this is translated to a union with null and default value set to
null. Because of Avro limitation, it means that other uses of this record cannot initialize
this field to another default value. This should be allowed because specific use case
may indeed have valid default values for that specific use of the record.

Although the new mode has been added, the default is to be backwards compatible and
translate the default value (instead of forcing the translation to null.) We may change
this to be the default in the future. However, this may break backwards compatibility of
generated schema in the case that the Avro default value is significant (i.e. fields
absent in writer schema but present in reader schema.)

(RB=72064)
Fix bug in which "include" and "fields" are not processed in the same order in
which they are defined.

As part of this fix, the parser needs to have knowledge of the location of
a data object within the input stream. JacksonCodec has been extended to

have been improved emit error messages that include the likely location
of the error.

ValidationOption and schema validation and fixup behavior has been refined.

The fixup boolean in ValidationOption has been replaced with CoercionMode.
This flag used to indicate whether primitive type coercion should occur and whether
the input Data objects can be modified.

There is minor incompatible change to RequiredMode.FIXUP_ABSENT_WITH_DEFAULT.
The old behavior is that the fixup flag must be set to allow
RequiredMode.FIXUP_ABSENT_WITH_DEFAULT to modify the input.
The new behavior is that RequiredMode.FIXUP_ABSENT_WITH_DEFAULT
alone allows validation to modify the input Data object.

RequiredMode and CoercionMode are independent of each other.
RequiredMode specifies how required fields should be handled.
CoercionMode specifies how coercion of primitive types should performed.

For backwards compatibility, setFixup(true) sets coercion mode to CoercionMode.NORMAL,
and isFixup returns true if coercion mode is not CoercionMode.OFF or required mode
is RequiredMode.FIXUP_ABSENT_WITH_DEFAULT.

(RB=71088)
Change in Data.Traverse callbacks for startMap and startList to pass the DataMap
and DataList about to be traversed. This is a change to Data API. Code search
indicates there are no other users of Data.Traverse outside of the data module.

Add experimental PSON binary serialization format for more compact serialized
representation by remembering which map keys have already be seen and assigning
a numeric index to each new key seen. Subsequent occurrence of the same key
requires only serializing the numeric index of the key instead of the string
representation of the key.

The PsonCodec is currently in test directory because it is still experimental
for understanding data compression possible and processor overhead for looking
up keys before serialization and potential savings from binary representation.

Add Java custom class binding support for primitive type.
You add a custom class binding by using a typeref with a "java" property.

The "java" property of the typeref declaration must be a map.
If this map has an "class" property, then the value of the "class"
property must be a string and this string provides the name of
the Java custom class for the typeref.

The generated code will now return and accept the Java custom class
as the return and argument type instead of the standard Java class
for the referenced type.

The custom class should meet the following requirements.

1. An instance of the custom class must be immutable.
2. A Coercer must be defined that can coerce the standard Java class
   of the type to the custom Java class of the type, in both the
   input and output directions. The coercer implements the
   DirectCoercer interface.
3. An instance of the coercer must be registered with the
   data template framework.

The following is an example illustrating Java custom class binding:

CustomPoint.pdsc:

{
  "type" : "typeref",
  "name" : "CustomPoint",
  "ref"  : "string",
  "java" : {
    "class" : "com.linkedin.data.template.TestCustom.CustomPoint"
  }
}

CustomPoint.java:

//
// The custom class
// It has to be immutable.
//
public class CustomPoint
{
  private int _x;
  private int _y;

  public CustomPoint(String s)
  {
    String parts[] = s.split(",");
    _x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
    _y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
  }

  public CustomPoint(int x, int y)
  {
    _x = x;
    _y = y;
  }

  public int getX()
  {
    return _x;
  }

  public int getY()
  {
    return _y;
  }

  public String toString()
  {
    return _x + "," + _y;
  }

  public boolean equals(Object o)
  {
    if (o == null)
      return false;
    if (this == o)
      return true;
    if (o.getClass() != getClass())
      return false;
    CustomPoint p = (CustomPoint) o;
    return (p._x == _x) && (p._y == _y);
  }

  //
  // The custom class's DirectCoercer.
  //
  public static class CustomPointCoercer implements DirectCoercer<CustomPoint>
  {
    @Override
    public Object coerceInput(CustomPoint object)
      throws ClassCastException
    {
      return object.toString();
    }

    @Override
    public CustomPoint coerceOutput(Object object)
      throws TemplateOutputCastException
    {
      if (object instanceof String == false)
      {
        throw new TemplateOutputCastException("Output " + object + " is not a string, and cannot be coerced to " + CustomPoint.class.getName());
      }
      return new CustomPoint((String) object);
    }
  }

  //
  // Automatically register Java custom class and its coercer.
  //

    Custom.registerCoercer(CustomPoint.class, new CustomPointCoercer());

(RB=62385)
Fix Avro schema converter such that default values for Avro unions can translated correctly.
Prior to this fix, the default value for an Avro union is encoded like similar using the JSON
serialization of the default value. The Avro specification specifies that the default value
for an union does not include the type discriminator, and the type is provided by the 1st
member of the union.

When a Data Schema is translated to an Avro Schema, if the union has a default value,
the default value's type must be the 1st member type of the union. Otherwise, an
IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. When a value of an union type is translated,
its translated value will not include the type discriminator.

When an Avro Schema is translated to a Data Schema, if the Avro union has a value,
the parser and validation function obtains the type of the value from the 1st member type
of union. The translated default value will include a type discriminator if translated type
remains a union after translation. (The translated type will not be a union if
the Avro union is the type for a field of a record and this union type has two members
and one of them is null as the field will become an optional field whose type is
the non-null member type of the union.)

Avro schema parser does not validate default values are valid, i.e. it does not validate the
default value for each field with the schema for the field. Pegasus schema parser will
perform this validation.

(RB=62715)
Add support for BatchResponseKV in BatchGet, which provides correctly typed Map keys for getResults() and getError().

/**
 * Pegasus code generation plugin.
 * <p>
 * Performs the following functions:
 * <p>
 * <b>Generate data model and data template jars for each source set.</b>
 * <p>
 * Generates data template source (.java) files from data schema (.pdsc) files,
 * compiles the data template source (.java) files into class (.class) files,
 * creates a data model jar file and a data template jar file.
 * The data model jar file contains the source data schema (.pdsc) files.
 * The data template jar file contains both the source data schema (.pdsc) files
 * and the generated data template class (.class) files.
 * <p>
 * In the data template generation phase, the plugin creates a new target source set
 * for the generated files. The new target source set's name is the input source set name's
 * suffixed with "GeneratedDataTemplate", e.g. "mainGeneratedDataTemplate".
 * The plugin invokes PegasusDataTemplateGenerator to generate data template source (.java) files
 * for all data schema (.pdsc) files present in the input source set's pegasus
 * directory, e.g. "src/main/pegasus". The generated data template source (.java) files
 * will be in the new target source set's java source directory, e.g.
 * "src/mainGeneratedDataTemplate/java". The dataTemplateGenerator configuration
 * specifies the classpath for loading PegasusDataTemplateGenerator. In addition to
 * the data schema (.pdsc) files in the pegasus directory, the dataModel configuration
 * specifies resolver path for the PegasusDataTemplateGenerator. The resolver path
 * provides the data schemas and previously generated data template classes that
 * may be referenced by the input source set's data schemas. In most cases, the dataModel
 * configuration should contain data template jars.
 * <p>
 * The next phase is the data template compilation phase, the plugin compiles the generated
 * data template source (.java) files into class files. The dataTemplateCompile configuration
 * specifies the pegasus jars needed to compile these classes. The compileClasspath of the
 * target source set is a composite of the dataModel configuration which includes the data template
 * classes that were previously generated and included in the dependent data template jars,
 * and the dataTemplateCompile configuration.
 * This configuration should specify a dependency on the Pegasus data jar.
 * <p>
 * The following phase is creating the the data model jar and the data template jar.
 * This plugin creates the data model jar that includes the contents of the
 * input source set's pegasus directory, and sets the jar file's classification to
 * "data-model". Hence, the resulting jar file's name should end with "-data-model.jar".
 * It adds the data model jar as an artifact to the dataModel configuration.
 * This jar file should only contain data schema (.pdsc) files.
 * <p>
 * This plugin also create the data template jar that includes the contents of the input
 * source set's pegasus directory and the java class output directory of the
 * target source set. It sets the jar file's classification to "data-template".
 * Hence, the resulting jar file's name should end with "-data-template.jar".
 * It adds the data template jar file as an artifact to the dataTemplate configuration.
 * This jar file contains both data schema (.pdsc) files and generated data template
 * class (.class) files.
 * <p>
 * This plugin will ensure that data template source files are generated before
 * compiling the input source set and before the idea and eclipse tasks. It
 * also adds the generated classes to the compileClasspath of the input source set.
 * <p>
 * The configurations that apply to generating the data model and data template jars
 * are as follow:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   The dataTemplateGenerator configuration specifies the classpath for
 *   PegasusDataTemplateGenerator. In most cases, it should be the Pegasus generator jar.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The dataTemplateCompile configuration specifies the classpath for compiling
 *   the generated data template source (.java) files. In most cases,
 *   it should be the Pegasus data jar.
 *   (The default compile configuration is not used for compiling data templates because
 *   it is not desirable to include non data template dependencies in the data template jar.)
 *   The configuration should not directly include data template jars. Data template jars
 *   should be included in the dataModel configuration.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The dataModel configuration provides the value of the "generator.resolver.path"
 *   system property that is passed to PegasusDataTemplateGenerator. In most cases,
 *   this configuration should contain only data template jars. The data template jars
 *   contain both data schema (.pdsc) files and generated data template (.class) files.
 *   PegasusDataTemplateGenerator will not generate data template (.java) files for
 *   classes that can be found in the resolver path. This avoids redundant generation
 *   of the same classes, and inclusion of these classes in multiple jars.
 *   The dataModel configuration is also used to publish the data model jar which
 *   contains only data schema (.pdsc) files.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The testDataModel configuration is similar to the dataModel configuration
 *   except it is used when generating data templates from test source sets.
 *   It extends from the dataModel configuration. It is also used to publish
 *   the data model jar from test source sets.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The dataTemplate configuration is used to publish the data template
 *   jar which contains both data schema (.pdsc) files and the data template class
 *   (.class) files generated from these data schema (.pdsc) files.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The testDataTemplate configuration is similar to the dataTemplate configuration
 *   except it is used when oublishing the data template jar files generated from
 *   test source sets.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Generate rest model and rest client jars for each source set.</b>
 * <p>
 * Generates the idl (.restspec.json) files from the input source set's
 * output class files, generates rest client source (.java) files from
 * the idl, compiles the rest client source (.java) files to
 * rest client class (.class) files, and creates a rest model jar file
 * and a rest-client jar file.
 * The rest model jar file contains the generated idl (.restspec.json) files.
 * The rest client jar file contains both the generated idl (.restspec.json)
 * files and the generated rest client class (.class) files.
 * <p>
 * In the idl generation phase, the plugin creates a new target source set
 * for the generated files. The new target source set's name is the input source set name's
 * suffixed with "GeneratedRest", e.g. "mainGeneratedRest".
 * The plugin invokes RestLiResourceModelExporter to generate idl (.restspec.json) files
 * for each IdlItem in the input source set's pegasus IdlOptions.
 * The generated idl files will be in target source set's idl directory,
 * e.g."src/mainGeneratedRest/idl".
 * <p>
 * For example, the following adds an IdlItem to the source set's pegasus IdlOptions.
 * <pre>
 *   pegasus.main.idlOptions.addIdlItem("groups", ['com.linkedin.restli.examples.groups.server'])
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The next phase is to generate the rest client source (.java) files from the
 * generated idl (.restspec.json) files using RestRequestBuilderGenerator.
 * The generated rest client source (.java) files will be in the new target source set's
 * java source directory, e.g. "src/mainGeneratedRest/java". The restClientGenerator
 * configuration specifies the classpath for loading RestLiResourceModelExporter
 * and for loading RestRequestBuilderGenerator.
 * <p>
 * RestRequestBuilderGenerator requires access to the data schemas referenced
 * by the idl. The dataModel configuration specifies the resolver path needed
 * by RestRequestBuilderGenerator to access the data schemas referenced by
 * the idl that is not in the source set's pegasus directory.
 * This plugin automatically includes the data schema (.pdsc) files in the
 * source set's pegasus directory in the resolver path.
 * In most cases, the dataModel configuration should contain data template jars.
 * The data template jars contains both data schema (.pdsc) files and generated
 * data template class (.class) files. By specifying data template jars instead
 * of data model jars, redundant generation of data template classes is avoided
 * as classes that can be found in the resolver path are not generated.
 * <p>
 * The next phase is the rest client compilation phase, the plugin compiles the generated
 * rest client source (.java) files into class files. The restClientCompile configuration
 * specifies the pegasus jars needed to compile these classes. The compile classpath
 * is a composite of the dataModel configuration which includes the data template
 * classes that were previously generated and included in the dependent data template jars,
 * and the restClientCompile configuration.
 * This configuration should specify a dependency on the Pegasus restli-client jar.
 * <p>
 * The following phase is creating the the rest model jar and the rest client jar.
 * This plugin creates the rest model jar that includes the
 * generated idl (.restspec.json) files, and sets the jar file's classification to
 * "rest-model". Hence, the resulting jar file's name should end with "-rest-model.jar".
 * It adds the rest model jar as an artifact to the restModel configuration.
 * This jar file should only contain idl (.restspec.json) files.
 * <p>
 * This plugin also create the rest client jar that includes the
 *  generated idl (.restspec.json) files and the java class output directory of the
 * target source set. It sets the jar file's classification to "rest-client".
 * Hence, the resulting jar file's name should end with "-rest-client.jar".
 * It adds the rest client jar file as an artifact to the restClient configuration.
 * This jar file contains both idl (.restspec.json) files and generated rest client
 * class (.class) files.
 * <p>
 * This plugin will ensure that generating idl will occur after compiling the
 * input source set. It will also ensure that idea and eclipse tasks runs after
 * rest client source (.java) files are generated.
 * <p>
 * The configurations that apply to generating the rest model and rest client jars
 * are as follow:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *   The restClientGenerator configuration specifies the classpath for
 *   RestLiResourceModelExporter and RestRequestBuilderGenerator.
 *   In most cases, it should be the Pegasus restli-tools jar.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The restClientCompile configuration specifies the classpath for compiling
 *   the generated rest client source (.java) files. In most cases,
 *   it should be the Pegasus restli-client jar.
 *   (The default compile configuration is not used for compiling rest client because
 *   it is not desirable to include non rest client dependencies, such as
 *   the rest server implementation classes, in the data template jar.)
 *   The configuration should not directly include data template jars. Data template jars
 *   should be included in the dataModel configuration.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The dataModel configuration provides the value of the "generator.resolver.path"
 *   system property that is passed to RestRequestBuilderGenerator.
 *   This configuration should contain only data template jars. The data template jars
 *   contain both data schema (.pdsc) files and generated data template (.class) files.
 *   The RestRequestBuilderGenerator will only generate rest client classes.
 *   The dataModel configuration is also included in the compile classpath for the
 *   generated rest client source files. The dataModel configuration does not
 *   include generated data template classes, then the Java compiler may not able to
 *   find the data template classes referenced by the generated rest client.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *   The testDataModel configuration is similar to the dataModel configuration
 *   except it is used when generating rest client source files from

 * <li>
 *   The restModel configuration is used to publish the rest model jar

Internal changes to replace Stack with ArrayList or ArrayDeque.

0.15.1
------
(RB=43133)

Main API change is removal/decoupling of validation from DataSchema.
DataSchema no longer has validate method. The replacement is
ValidateDataAgainstSchema.validate(...).

Reduce memory allocation for DataElement for each object visited.
Will reuse same DataElement for each member of a container.
As part of this change, it is no longer possible to get a
standard Iterator from a builder. The alternative is to use the
traverse method that takes a callback for each object iterated.

Add support for different pre-order and post-order traversal
to ObjectIterator. This allows ObjectIterator to be used for
data to schema validation. This unification allows single pass
data to schema validation as well as calling Validator after
fixup and schema validation.

Enhance DataSchemaAnnotationValidator to not throw exception
on construction. Allow validator to be used if only some
validators are constructed. Use common Message classes for emitting
initialization messages.

Refactor code to allow both iterative and recursive validation.

Add more test cases.

-----
(RB=43604)

Add support to taking DataElement as starting point for
iterating through Data objects and for validation. This
has been requested by Identity superblock where the patch
is applied to position (using position as starting point), but
the root object is a profile. The validation should start
where the patch is applied, but the validator plugin wants
access to the entire entity, i.e. the profile entity.

Add tests and bug fix unnecessary additional calls to validators
from ValidateDataAgainstSchema when typerefs are in use. The
bug was that the downstream validator will be called once per
typeref in the typeref chain. The correct and fixed behavior
is that the downstream validator will be called once per
data object (not once per schema typeref'ed).

0.15
----

Add pluggable validator to Data Schemas (RB=41693)

1. Change behavior of ObjectIterator to include returning the
   input value.

2. See com.linkedin.data.validator package and TestValidator
   class for how to use validators.

3. This is still a prototype feature.

Output Avro-compliant equivalent JSON from Pegasus schema (RB=41878)

Add translation between Pegasus DataMap and Avro GenericRecord (RB=42130)

1. Also include refactoring of DataSchema to JSON encoding to
   move Avro specific code out of cow module into cow-avro module.

Rest.li support for full and partial updates
  Full update (overwrite) is transported as an HTTP PUT to the entity URI,
with a payload containing the JSON serialized RecordTemplate of the entity
schema.

  Partial update (patch) is transported as an HTTP POST to the entity URI,
with a payload containing a JSON serialized PatchRequest

The internal structure of a PatchRequest is documented here:
https://iwww.corp.linkedin.com/wiki/cf/display/ENGS/Partial+Update

PatchRequests can be generated on the client side by "diff'ing" two
RecordTemplate objects using PatchGenerator in com.linkedin.restli.client.utility.
Patch Generation relies on the facilities from the data-transform pegasus
component, in the com.linkedin.data.transform package.

PatchRequests can be applied on the server side by providing a pre-image
RecordTemplate object and a PatchRequest to PatchApplier in
com.linkedin.restli.server.util.  Patch application uses the DataMapProcessor
from the pegasus data-transform component.

Full and Partial update are provided as overloaded update() methods in
CollectionResource/AssociationResource on the server-side and as overloaded
buildUpdate() methods in EntityRequestBuilder on the client-side.

PARTIAL_UPDATE is defined as a new ResourceMethod, and listed as appropriate
in the IDL "supports" clause of the resource.

Support for deep (nested) projections has been implemented:
  Server-side, the rest.li framework understands both the old "field1,field2,field3"
syntax and the new PAL-style "field1,field2:(nestedfield)" syntax.  Projections
are applied automatically by the framework, using pegasus data-transform.
ResourceContext provides access to the projections as either a Set<String> or a MaskTree.

  Client-side, the generated RecordTemplate classes have been modified to
provide fields as a nested class accessed through the .fields() static method.
Each field can be accessed as a Path object through a fieldName() method, which
provides full static typing.  Fields are provided as methods rather than member
variables to avoid initialization cycles when a RecordTemplate contains a field of
the same type.

Deep projection support is currently *disabled* on the client side, to avoid ordering
issues with deployment.  Once all services have been deployed to production with the
new pegasus version, we will enable deep projections on the client side.

More background on projection support is available here:
https://iwww.corp.linkedin.com/wiki/cf/display/ENGS/Projections

Compatibility:
WIRE: This change is wire INCOMPATIBLE for existing users of update.  There are
no known uses of update in production.

CLIENT: This change is library INCOMPATIBLE for users of update, projection fields,
or code that relies on the types of framework ...Builder classes (a type parameter has
been removed).  Client code will need to be upgraded.

SERVER: This change is library INCOMPATIBLE for users of update.  Server code will
need to be upgraded to use PatchRequests and PatchApplier.

(RB=41257)

1. Add support for typeref to enable aliasing primitive types.
   Typeref works for any type (not just primitive).
   There is no support yet for binding different Java classes
   to the typeref'ed types.
   If a typeref is member of union, then the accessor method
   names for accessing the member are derived from the typeref
   name.

2. Serialization protocol and format does not change. The serialized
   representation of the member key is always the actual type, i.e.
   the type reached by following chain of typerefs.

3. Rest.li @Action and @ActionParam now has optional 'typeref'
   attribute that specifies the typeref that should be emitted to
   the IDL instead of the type inferred from the Java type.
   The provided typeref must be compatible with the Java type.

   KNOWN ISSUE - Unions cannot be used as return or parameter for
   actions.

(RB=41200)

  1. Provide human readable locations when Jackson parse errors occurs.

Data Schema Resolver (RB=41014)

  1. RUM pegasus plugin will not have to unjar before passing data schema jars to
     pegasus.  See seperate review for changes to plugin.

  2. Remove location from in-memory representation of schemas. Location is only used
     for generating Java bindings and checking for freshness of generated files.
     It is not needed to in-memory representation. Storing them in in-memory bindings
     may cause file "leaks" as they refer to jar files and files.

  3. Simply by removing FIELDS_ONLY record type.

(RB=40353)

  1. Minor changes to comments in rpc-demo-client.

  2. Fix pdpr and avsc references in tools/rest-doc-generator/docgen.py

Data Schema Generator

  1. Fixes a bug in which parse errors are not sent to output.
     There is no other functional changes.

Data Schema changes

  1. Add "optional" support to record schema.
     In previous version, "default" is used to provide
     default value as well as indicate that the field is
     optional in a record. In the new version, "optional"
     is orthogonal to "default". A default value can be
     specified for optional as well as mandatory fields.
     An "optional" field may or may not have a default value.

  2. Change extension of data schema files from avsc to pdsc.
     This change requires 0.12.7 version of RUM for the new
     version of PegasusGeneratorPlugin that understands the new
     file name extension. This version of plugin also expects
     data schema files to be in the pegasus directory instead
     of the avro directory. The plugin also works with older
     projects that use the previous version of Pegasus, i.e.
     uses avro directories and avsc as the file name extension.

RestLi (RB=38654)

  1.  Merge EntityResource into CollectionResource / AssociationResource,
      to simplify resource definition

  2.  RestLiRouter internal cleanup.

  3.  Remove anonymous finder functionality, to reserve "GET /collection/"
      for future use.
  4.  Remove JAX-RS / Jersey dependencies from library APIs.

  5.  Minimize JAX-RS / Jersey usage internally.

  6.  Extract Annotation classes to top-level, to assist in IDE
      auto-import.

  7.  Invert parent/child dependency in resource annotations (replace "root=false"
      with "parent=Xyz.class").

  8.  ResourceModel internal cleanup.

  9.  Support compound keys for collections.

  10. Cleanup PathKeys and CompoundKey interfaces.

  11. Remove rest-jax-rs-prototype from active repository
