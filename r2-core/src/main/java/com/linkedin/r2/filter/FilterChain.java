/**
 * A chain of {@link Filter}s that get a chance to process or modify the request, wire attributes,
 * and local attributes.<p/>
 *
 * <dl>
 *  <dt>Immutability</dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Filter chains are immutable. Adding a new filter does not change the filter chain but
 *      instead produces a copy of the filter chain with the new filter inserted.
 *  </dd>
 *
 *  <dt>Filter Order</dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Requests are processed starting from the beginning of the chain and move towards the end of
 *      the filter chain. Responses are processed from the end of the filter chain and move back
 *      towards the beginning of the filter chain.<p/>
 *
 *      If a request filter throws an exception, calls {@code nextFilter.onResponse(...)}, or
 *      calls {@code nextFilter.onError(..)} then that filter will have the appropriate response
 *      method invoked (onResponse or onError). The response will flow back towards the beginning
 *      of the filter chain. Filters later in the chain will not get a change to process the
 *      request or the response.
 *  </dd>
 *
 *  <dt>Filter Priority</dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      It is possible to implement a generic message filter and a message filter specific to a
 *      request type. In general, this should be avoided. If a filter implements both
 *      types of interfaces then the more specific one is invoked and the less specific one is
 *      ignored.
 *  </dd>
 *
 *  <dt>Wire Attributes</dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Wire attributes provide a mechanism for sending request or response metadata to the remote
 *      endpoint. As an example, this facility can be used to send a unique request identifier from
 *      a client to a server.
 *  </dd>
 *
 *  <dt>Local Attributes</dt>
 *  <dd>
 *      Filters must be stateless, so local attributes provide a mechanism for saving some state
 *      during the request which can be used during response processing. As an example, this
 *      facility can be used to store the time at which a request began so that total request
 *      latency can be logged when the response is received.
 *  </dd>
